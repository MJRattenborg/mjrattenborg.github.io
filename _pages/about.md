I am a PhD Fellow at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen, where I am a member of the research unit [Behavioral Economics and Labor Market Performance](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/ResearchCentres/labor-market-performance/). My PhD supervisors are [Steffen Altmann](https://sites.google.com/site/steffenaltmann/) and [Robert Mahlstedt](http://www.robertmahlstedt.com/).  <br>

Currently, I am also a Visiting Fellow at the [School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR)](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/about-ilr) at Cornell University. 

My research fields are labor economics and behavioral economics, with a particular focus on job search. I am especially interested in the implications of biased beliefs for job search behavior and labor market outcomes. My research combines (i) theoretical work at the intersection of behavioral and labor economics and (ii) econometric methods using administrative, survey and job search data. You can find more information about my ongoing research [here](https://mjrattenborg.github.io/research/) <br>

I have gained teaching experience in theoretical microeconomics with a focus on game theory. You can find more information about my teaching experience [here](https://mjrattenborg.github.io/teaching/)
