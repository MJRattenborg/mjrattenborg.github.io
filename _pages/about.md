I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Economics at the University of Cologne, where I am a member of the research unit of [Johannes Wohlfart](https://sites.google.com/site/johanneswohlfartecon/home). <br>

I submitted my PhD Thesis at the Department of Economics at the University of Copenhagen. During my PhD, I was affiliated with the research group [Behavioral Economics and Labor Market Performance](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/ResearchCentres/labor-market-performance/). My PhD supervisors were [Steffen Altmann](https://sites.google.com/site/steffenaltmann/), [Robert Mahlstedt](http://www.robertmahlstedt.com/) and [Alexander Sebald](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandersebald/main)  <br>

In 2024, I was a Visiting Fellow at the [School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR)](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/about-ilr) at Cornell University, by invitation of [Philipp Kircher](https://philippkircher.com/) <br>

My research lies at the intersection of labor and behavioral economics, with a focus on job search and unemployment. I combine online job search data with administrative records and field experiments to study belief formation among job seekers and the implications of beliefs for search behavior. Methodologically, my work integrates: <br>
  1. Theoretical modeling at the intersection of behavioral and labor economics. <br>
  2. Econometric analysis using administrative, survey, and job search data. <br>
  3. Field experiments designed to test theory-driven mechanisms.

I have gained teaching experience in theoretical microeconomics with a focus on game theory. You can find more information about my teaching experience [here](https://mjrattenborg.github.io/teaching/)
