I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Economics at the University of Cologne, where I am a member of the research unit of [Johannes Wohlfart](https://sites.google.com/site/johanneswohlfartecon/home). <br>

I submitted my PhD Thesis at the Department of Economics at the University of Copenhagen, where I was a member of the research unit [Behavioral Economics and Labor Market Performance](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/ResearchCentres/labor-market-performance/). My PhD supervisors were [Steffen Altmann](https://sites.google.com/site/steffenaltmann/), [Robert Mahlstedt](http://www.robertmahlstedt.com/) and [Alexander Sebald](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandersebald/main)  <br>

In 2024, I was a Visiting Fellow at the [School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR)](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/about-ilr) at Cornell University, by invitation of [Philipp Kircher](https://philippkircher.com/) <br>

My research interests lie in labor and behavioral economics, with a focus job search and unemployment. I combine online job search data with administrative records and field experiments to investigate the belief formation process of job seekers and the implications of beliefs for search behaviior. My approach combines: <br>
  1. Theoretical modeling at the intersection of behavioral and labor economics. <br>
  2. Econometric analysis using administrative, survey, and job search data. <br>
  3. Field experiments to investigate mechanisms informed by theory.

I have gained teaching experience in theoretical microeconomics with a focus on game theory. You can find more information about my teaching experience [here](https://mjrattenborg.github.io/teaching/)
