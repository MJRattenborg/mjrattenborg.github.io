I am doing a PhD at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ku.dk/) at the Univeristy of Copenhagen. I am a member of the research unit [Behavioral Economics and Labor Market Performance](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/ResearchCentres/labor-market-performance/). My research fields are labor economics and behavioral economics, with a particular focus on job search. You can find more information about my ongoing research [HERE]() <br>

I have teaching experience in theoretical microeconomics with a focus on game theory, at the master's level. You can find more information about my teaching experience [HERE]()
