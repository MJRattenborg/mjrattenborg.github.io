I am a PhD Fellow at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen, where I am a member of the research unit [Behavioral Economics and Labor Market Performance](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/ResearchCentres/labor-market-performance/). My PhD supervisors are [Steffen Altmann](https://sites.google.com/site/steffenaltmann/) and [Robert Mahlstedt](http://www.robertmahlstedt.com/).  <br>

Currently, I am also a Visiting Fellow at the [School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR)](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/about-ilr) at Cornell University. 

My research interests lie in labor and behavioral economics, with a focus on job search. In particular, I investigate how biased beliefs influence job search behavior and labor market outcomes. My approach combines:
  (i) Theoretical modeling at the intersection of behavioral and labor economics.
  (ii) Econometric analysis using administrative, survey, and job search data.

I have gained teaching experience in theoretical microeconomics with a focus on game theory. You can find more information about my teaching experience [here](https://mjrattenborg.github.io/teaching/)
